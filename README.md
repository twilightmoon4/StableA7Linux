# StableA7Linux for iOS10.3.3

I come here to release you my beta of the StableA7 port for Linux

Is downgrade for iOS10.3.3 in A7 iDevices

## What do you need to install?

 - A Ubuntu / Debian based Linux distro more recent (I recommend Xubuntu 19.10 which I use) , installed, no Live CD

 - Patience (very important)

 - A brain (very rare)

 - Your **A7** iDevice in DFU mode

 - *Open Software&Updates (or Software Sources depending on your Linux distro or even Additional Drivers) and enable all sources on the Other Software tab*

## Running the tool

```
git clone https://github.com/twilightmoon4/StableA7Linux.git
cd StableA7Linux
sudo apt-get update
chmod +x *
```
Place IPSW in same folder as script, renaming it `restore.ipsw`
```
sudo bash StableA7.sh
```
*(Warning, the exploit can be very inconsistent, so be patient)*

Okay, after a whike the exploit works, then, congratulations! Your A7 iDevice will be on iOS 10.3.3 <3
